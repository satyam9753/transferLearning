Transfer learning, is a research problem in machine learning that focuses on storing knowledge gained while solving one problem and applying it to a different but related problem.

Why Transfer Learning?

* In practice a very few people train a Convolution network from scratch (random initialisation) because it is rare to get enough dataset. So, using pre-trained network weights as initialisations or a fixed feature extractor helps in solving most of the problems in hand.

* Very Deep Networks are expensive to train. The most complex models take weeks to train using hundreds of machines equipped with expensive GPUs.

* Determining the topology/flavour/training method/hyper parameters for deep learning is a black art with not much theory to guide you.
